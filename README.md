# [cite_start]ANN-Based Solution for Inverse Kinematics (MTE438 Assignment One) [cite: 27]

[cite_start]This repository contains the code and report for solving the inverse kinematics problem of a two-link manipulator using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with TensorFlow Keras[cite: 1, 3, 27, 29]. [cite_start]The project is part of the MTE438: AI in Mechatronics and Robotics course[cite: 26].

## Problem Description ü§ñ

[cite_start]The goal is to predict the joint angles ($\theta_1, \theta_2$) required for a two-link planar manipulator (with link lengths $a_1=1$ and $a_2=1$) to reach a given end-effector position $(x, y)$[cite: 2, 36, 41]. [cite_start]This is the inverse kinematics problem[cite: 1, 2].



## Methodology üß†

[cite_start]An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is implemented using TensorFlow Keras[cite: 3, 43].
* [cite_start]**Input:** End-effector coordinates $(x, y)$[cite: 36, 43].
* [cite_start]**Output:** Predicted joint angles $(\theta_1, \theta_2)$[cite: 4, 36, 43].
* [cite_start]**Architecture:** The model uses fully connected (Dense) layers with ReLU activation functions in the hidden layers[cite: 4, 5, 44]. [cite_start]The specific architecture used here consists of an input layer (2 neurons), one hidden layer (64 neurons), another hidden layer (32 neurons), and an output layer (2 neurons)[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]**Training Data:** Generated using the forward kinematics equations for the manipulator, creating pairs of joint angles and their corresponding end-effector positions[cite: 6, 37, 40].
* [cite_start]**Training:** The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and the mean squared error loss function[cite: 8, 46].
* [cite_start]**Evaluation:** Performance is evaluated on a separate testing dataset using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) between predicted and actual joint angles[cite: 10, 14, 56].

## Setup and Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/ann-inverse-kinematics.git
    cd ann-inverse-kinematics
    ```
2.  (Recommended) Create and activate a Python virtual environment.
3.  Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage üöÄ

1.  Navigate to the `code/` directory.
2.  Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `120200214.ipynb`.
3.  This will perform the following steps:
    * [cite_start]Generate the training and testing data (saving `.csv` files to the `data/` directory)[cite: 40].
    * [cite_start]Define and compile the ANN model architecture[cite: 4, 43, 44].
    * [cite_start]Train the model using the training data (saving the `.h5` model file to the `models/` directory)[cite: 46].
    * [cite_start]Evaluate the model on the testing data and calculate the MAE[cite: 55, 56].
    * [cite_start]Plot training/validation loss curves and sample predictions[cite: 11, 13, 57].

## Results üìä

[cite_start]The model demonstrated promising performance in predicting the joint angles[cite: 18]. [cite_start]The training and validation loss decreased over epochs, indicating good convergence[cite: 11]. [cite_start]Visual inspection of sample predictions showed reasonable accuracy[cite: 13, 57]. [cite_start]The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) quantifies the prediction accuracy[cite: 14, 56].

## Future Work ü§î

[cite_start]Potential future work could involve exploring more complex network architectures, adding more data, or incorporating physical constraints[cite: 21].
